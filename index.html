          <h6>About</h6>
          <p>
            Hi there! I am Andrew. Math and sciences are strengths of mine. In high school, I took a variety of math and science classes including HP Pre-Calculus, AP Calculus, AP Statics and AP Physics. I continued to take many advanced math, sciences and engineering course at the University of California, Irvine. After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, I spent 11 years in construction design and consulting. During that time, I became a professionally licensed engineer in the State of California specializing in HVAC Design and successfully designed and managed many successful construction of many institutional buildings including university science buildings, hospitals and pharmeucetical laboratories. I eventually decided to change careers into tech. I taught myself how to code and am currently a software engineer working at an industry leading geopgrahic information system software company.  
          </p>
          <p>
            During college, I tutored K-12 math for The Tutoring Center. My strategy for helping students learn math was to solve as many math problems during a session on a white board and have them explain to me how they would go about solving the problems. The reason for having them do this is so I can understand their approach to the problem, the givens to a problem they are seeing and are not seeing, and how efficiently they can solve the problem. From this, I help offer ideas to help them identify all the givens, and solve problems more efficiently. 
          </p>

            First 1-hr session is free. In the first session, I typically would like to know what the student wants out of the sessions, his or her goals, and we would come up with an initial plan to reach those goals. We would go over some practice problems that the student may have for the remainder of the session.
